# Circle Of Fifths Jam Board
A small app I created that provides the user with a highly visual way to interact with the circle of fifths.

Inspired by [Vox's Youtube Video ~ "The most feared song in jazz, explained"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62tIvfP9A2w)

Visit the live demo [here](https://jakemartin1234.github.io/circle-of-fifths-jam-board/)

To run locally, clone the repo and run `npm install` then `npm start`.
